                        <h3>Your field of focus</h3>
                        <p>Your primary field of study is called your concentration. We offer more than 49 defined programs, many of which are interdisciplinary. A student interested in integrating two areas of study may apply to pursue a joint concentration. Not all departments support joint concentrations, but those that do will usually require that you undertake a senior thesis that integrates the two disciplinary areas. A joint concentration is different from a double major that you might pursue at another school.</p>
